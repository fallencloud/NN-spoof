# City Of Newport News Spoof

In this project, I'm combining my Bootstrap, Express, Node, and MongoDB skills to create a redesigned spoof of the City of Newport News Website.

1. Create a front-end using Bootstrap 4.
2. Create a server in Express.
3. Server the front-end using Pug.
4. Translate the data into JSON.
5. Interpolate the data into the the Pug files.
6. Store the data in a MongoDB.
7. Pull the data from the DB and insert into the Pug files.
